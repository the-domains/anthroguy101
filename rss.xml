            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The end of Tumblr</strong></p>,<p>This web site used to redirect to a Tumblr blog. Now it redirects here.</p>,<p>As of 2018-12-17 Tumblr will no longer allow adult content on its web site. While this decision does not affect me personally, and while there will be no adult content on this page, there are plenty of others who used to use the service to promote adult material.</p>,<p>Out of principle the decision was made to use a different platform. anthroguy101.us will now be a multimedia blog on anther platform that will remain undisclosed. All the texts, images and video that are blogworthy will show up on this page.</p>,<p>The Tumblr blog became idle and was mainly a dumping ground for Instagram posts. There were few articles or anything to note on there. It can still be accessed from <a href="https://anthroguy101.tumblr.com/" title="">https://anthroguy101.tumblr.com</a>.</p>,<p>All new posts will appear here. There will be no more updates on Tumblr.</p>,<p>I have decided to start fresh. Thank you for understanding.</p>]]></description>
